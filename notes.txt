We're gna do some front end stuff. rubrics says 4 pages at least, so it's gonna be:
    list page
    create
    edit

ok we're missing one. We could set up crud for another object like category, 
but that means doubling my backend work, and I want to finish this asap to do mad.
So maybe we can make a customer page to see the activities, but how will that set it apart from the admin list view?

ok nvm we'll figure that along the way. Let's start with the list view, then.

right, so I've linked the list view up but the request to the backend is not working. Network connection issue.

files/folders created:
everything in Admin/activities
everything in pages/Activities

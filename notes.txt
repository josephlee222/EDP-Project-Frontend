stuff done:
homepage design

partially implemented create avdailbaility. Functionality is there, 
but i want the dates that have an availability to be highlighted which it curretnly is not.

core Functionalities:
    for customer:
        find and book an activity
        create a review
        view activity
        view availability
        view reviews

    for admin:
        view, like, everything
        create (almost) everything too

final core funcitonality to implement:
    integrate availability into booking

advanced functionalities:
    easy viewing of availability (doing that rn)
    filter for activities:
        name
        tags (r we even doing tag? I dunno)
        category obviously
        date

    integration with coupon for payment (I think joseph will do this tho)
    send activity to friends
    
ok that should b it for now ig

estimated amt of time to finish up core functionalities: 3h
estimated amt of time to implement all currently listed advanced features: max 15h depends on how many bugs ig

we'll aim to finish most of the functional stuff by saturday night, with a buffer until sunday.
Tuesday ideally should be all styling.

uploading and viewing of photos is done.
CRUD for categories as well.
I can do CRUD for coupon now but i can't implement the actual usage right now cuz joseph hasn't done the cart.


stuff to do:
photo upload for reviews-
category filtering (make category a dropdown for create and edit activity)
coupon CRUD
maybe some styling for activity list and details as well.

beyond that, we don't really have that many funcitonalities to work on anymore.
Everything after this is just refinement.

letsgo photo upload and display for review works
so i was thinking, when u click on a review it should take u to a page to display the details of the review too.

dropdown for category for create activtiy is done. Will do it for edit next.
coupon crud is done.

a bit overwhelmed at what to do. Probably will focus on aesthetics for a while.
Gna do activity details, i guess.

made some carousel looking thing for activity details with animation too yay.
Still have a LOT of work to do before the site actually looks good, but this is great progress.

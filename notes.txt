stuff done:
homepage design

partially implemented create avdailbaility. Functionality is there, 
but i want the dates that have an availability to be highlighted which it curretnly is not.

core Functionalities:
    for customer:
        find and book an activity
        create a review
        view activity
        view availability
        view reviews

    for admin:
        view, like, everything
        create (almost) everything too

final core funcitonality to implement:
    integrate availability into booking

advanced functionalities:
    easy viewing of availability (doing that rn)
    filter for activities:
        name
        tags (r we even doing tag? I dunno)
        category obviously
        date

    integration with coupon for payment (I think joseph will do this tho)
    send activity to friends
    
ok that should b it for now ig

estimated amt of time to finish up core functionalities: 3h
estimated amt of time to implement all currently listed advanced features: max 15h depends on how many bugs ig

we'll aim to finish most of the functional stuff by saturday night, with a buffer until sunday.
Tuesday ideally should be all styling.
